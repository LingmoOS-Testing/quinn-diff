	* Packages-arch-specific: Added cqcam as `i386 alpha' on grounds
	of PC-Hardware orientation.  Bumped Packages-arch-specific-version
	field to 3 due to use of new `%' prefix.  Made use of '%' prefix.
	Removed ldso and ldconfig.

1998-12-02  James Troup  <james@nocrew.org>

	* configure.in (VERSION): 0.45.

	configure.
	(opt_debug): don't pass -Wtraditional as it produces warnings I
	can't be bothered to track down with the new hash function and in
	any event, quinn diff surely won't compile on a non-ANSI compiler
	anyway.

Tue Oct 27 12:15:48 1998  James Troup  <james@nocrew.org>

	* configure.in: define AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR to `scripts' and hide
 	configure cruft (mkinstalldirs, missing, install-sh) in there.

	* Makefile.am (dist-hook): find all copies of distfiles and use
 	this file to ensure directories containing nothing but scripts,
 	etc. are included in the release tar ball.  (Gratuitously stolen
 	from gnupg)
	(SUBDIRS): drop `debian' and `example_scripts' as they are now
 	handled by the $dir/distfiles mechanism.

 	field.  Add the version number magic string.

	* configure.in: rewrote electric fence handling macro to be more
 	sane.  Explicitly override CFLAGS for debug/optimization flags

Fri May 15 13:44:26 1998  James Troup  <jjtroup@comp.brad.ac.uk>

	* Packages-arch-specific: Exclude binutils on m68k, as 2.9.1 is
 	producing broken kernel images and we do not want to upgrade.
  	Make libregex0* i386 and m68k specific as they are libc5-compat
 	packages that only these architectures want.

# Quinn Diff packages-arch-specific file

# Current Quinn Diff input files for Debian can be downloaded from
# `https://buildd.debian.org/quinn-diff/'.
#
# The architecture fields are like build-depends architecture
# specifiers (see policy manual).
#
# Packages prefixed with '%' are source packages; for multi-binary
# source packages this means _all_ binaries from the package are
# considered architecture specific.
#
# Packages marked "[?]" or ANAIS (Architecture Not Allowed In Source)
# reflect the restrictions of the source package but are questionable
# and should be revisited by someone with more time.

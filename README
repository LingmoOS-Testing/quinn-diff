This is the README file for quinn diff version 0.65.

Quinn diff is a program for comparing a Sources file and a Packages
files to determine which programs need (re)compiled from source for
any given architecture.

Quinn diff knows about architecture specific packages (e.g. lilo) and
can easily exlcude them via a Packages-arch-specific file.  The output
is a list of source packages complete with accurate section and
version information, suitable for use in build daemons or just in a
script to auto-snarf the necessary source.

See TODO for an incomplete list of things needing to be done.

See the file NEWS for user-visible changes since the last version.

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

Quinn diff has been built and tested on the following platforms :-

Linux/i386 2.4
Linux/sparc 2.4

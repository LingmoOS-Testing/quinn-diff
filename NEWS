This is a list of user-visible changes in each released version, more
detailed changes history can be found in the ChangeLog.

Version 0.64 - 30th January, 2003

* quinn-diff now distinguishes between 'partial' and 'uncompiled'
  packages; the former being where some binary packages built by a
  source package are missing but the packages is otherwise up-to-date
  and the latter meaning that none of a source package's architecture
  dependent packages have been recompiled for the architecture.


Version 0.63 - 20th January, 2003

* Problems with quinn-diff ignoring source packages that bogusly
  claimed to build binary packages actually built by other source
  packages have been fixed.


Version 0.62 - 19th August, 2002

* The fix for architecture comparison from 0.61 now actually works.
  Thanks again to ryan Murray <rmurray@debian.org>.


Version 0.61 - 18th August, 2002

* Architecture comparison has been fixed so that, e.g. mips is
  correctly differentiated from mipsel.  Thanks to Ryan Murray
  <rmurray@debian.org> for the patch.


Version 0.60 - 10th January, 2001

* Take the Architecture: field into consideration and ignore packages
  that are not Architecture: all or the architecture we're interested
  in.


Version 0.59 - 18th December, 2001

* Fixed a bug in the Packages-arch-specific handling that was causing
  some packages to be incorrectly marked as architecture specific.



Vesrion 0.57 - 7th December, 2001

* Fixed quinn-diff to support a zero-length or almost-empty Packages file.

* Support a -i/--ignore-arch-all flag to ignore source packages which
  are marked as 'Architecture: all'.



Vesrion 0.56 - 25th May, 2001

* Fixed the compiled/out-of-date markers so that they reflect reality
  a little better.


Version 0.55 - 24th May, 2001

* Fixed a 'free-ing memory twice' crash.


Version 0.54 - 20th May, 2001

* Support -A/--architecture to override the automagic determination of
  architecture of Packages file.

* Handle duplicates in both Packages and Sources by comparing version
  numbers and discarding the older copy.


Version 0.53 - 1st September, 2000

* Fix a long-standing bug that was causing the section and priority to
  disappear from the output for random packages.

* A crash on Packages files with nothing but 'Architecture: all'
  packages has been fixed.

* The new Sources and Packages files produced by apt-ftparchive are
  now handled.


Version 0.50 - 30th May, 1999

* Rewrite.  Quinn Diff now compares a Packages file and a Sources
  file, i.e. it compares any given architecture to the source not to
  some other architecture.  This gets us away from the broken model of
  a primary and secondary architecture, which wasn't always true.  It
  also allows one to run quinn diff for the i386 ``port''.

* Packages marked as hurd-i386 specific in Packages-arch-specific are
  now correctly noted as such.

* There is now a man page.

* Packages-arch-specific is now installed into /etc/ and Quinn Diff
  looks for it there.


Version 0.46 - 4th December, 1998

* The Packages-arch-specific file can now be used to mark entire
  source packages as architecture specific by use of a '%' prefix.


Version 0.45 - 2nd December, 1998

* create_Packages-source has been sped up more.

* Quinn Diff was broken by recent Packages files which has gnome-*
  packages with Depends lines in excess of 400 characters; sick of
  hardcoded limits in quinn diff, I've removed them all.

* Quinn Diff now uses GTK+'s glib library for hash functions rather
  than libdb.  libdb was overkill and the version from glibc 2.1
  didn't work with quinn diff.  glib's hash functions are more light
  weight and better suited to what quinn diff is doing and switching
  to it fixed several previously unresolveable problems with the new
  use of dynamically allocated memory for all strings related to
  input.

* Quinn Diff now uses less memory after the plugging of some memory
  leaks and more intelligent freeing of buffers.

* A bug in code that tried to handle broken Packages-sources file has
  been fixed so it won't output epochs as part of a source package
  version number.


Version 0.44 - 17th October, 1998

* A stupid bug which was causing problems (alphabetically early
  Architecture: all packages were being erroneously listed as
  uncompiled) on underpopulated architectures (e.g. hurd-i386) has
  been fixed.

* The example scripts have been improved in small ways and fixed in
  some cases (quinn-diff_split_by_status has been broken since 0.41).


Version 0.43 - 7th October, 1998

* Quinn Diff will now die on duplicates in the Packages-source file as
  this invariable represents a mirror in a bad way and Quinn Diff's
  output will be compromised.

* A heuristic designed to help spot bad mirrors, which was actually
  causing information lossage in rare cases, has been disabled.

* Quinn Diff now checks for a version string in the first line of
  Packages-arch-specific; if it finds a version newer than it can
  parse, it will refuse to even try.

* Quinn Diff now supports exclusionary architecture fields in the
  Packages-arch-specific-file, e.g. "!m68k" means that the package is
  suitable for all architectures _except_ m68k.


Version 0.42 - 27th September, 1998

* Quinn Diff now accepts a -o/--source-packages option for specifiying
  an alternate name for Packages-source.

* A spurious debugging error() call which was left in by mistake has
  been removed.

* Quinn diff will no longer crash on malformed Packages-* files.

* snarf_Packages-source has been supplemented by a python script to
  replace the spawning of several thousands seds, speeding it up by
  some 26 times or more.

* Quinn diff will now complain loudly about duplicates in the
  Packages-source file and die on libdb-related errors.

* Quinn diff no longer tries to guess if the package is libc5 or libc6
  based as this information was only useful during the libc5 -> libc6
  conversion process hamm underwent.


Version 0.41 - 18th July, 1998

* Quinn diff now handles the long version strings like
  "4.17-4.m68k.objc.threads.hwwp.fpu.gnat" found in slink.

* The snarf_Packages-source script has been rewritten to be less
  insecure, more flexible and suck less.

* The configure script now supports --with-includes, --with-efence and
  --with-debug.

* The -D/--debug option accepts "help" as an argument and displays
  help information on receiving it.


Version 0.40 - 23rd June, 1998

* --debug's short form is now -D in line with YAWN (see
 http://yawn.nocrew.org) and dpkg.

* There is a new option -w/--visible-warn, which controls which
  category of suspect packages are shown.  Currently only packages
  where the source version numbers mismatch are considered suspect.


Version 0.31 - 18th April, 1998

* Most of the example scripts have been updated so that they work again.

* Quinn Diff will now print "uncompiled" or "out-of-date" for each
  package depending on whether or not the package has ever been
  compiled on the secondary architecture before or not.


Version 0.30 - 10th April, 1998

* The --warn-missing-lines and --warn-duplicates command line switches
  no longer exist.  --warn-missing-lines is now implemented in a more
  sane fashion with checks for existence only done on relevant lines,
  and --warn-duplicates is now enabled through the new --debug switch.

* Quinn Diff will no longer die on duplicate packages in the
  Packages-arch-specific file, it'll will (silently or not, as --debug
  dictates) ignore the duplicates.

* Quinn Diff's command line interface has changed.  It's no longer
  necessary (or even possible) to specify the two Packages files as
  arguments, instead there are 3 new command line options:
 
 -a --arch-specific-packages  filename of Packages-arch-specific file.
                               default: Packages-arch-specific in cwd
 -p --primary-packages        filename of primary architectures Packages file.
                               default: Packages-primary in cwd
 -s --secondary-packages      filename of secondary architectures Packages file.
                               default: Packages-secondary in cwd

* Quinn Diff now correctly exits with an error message when passed an
  unrecognised command line option.

* Quinn Diff now requires a new file Packages-sources, this file lists
  the section and version number of every source package.  There is a
  script (quinn1.3.sh) as a (poor) example of how to generate a
  Packages-sources file.

* Quinn Diff has a new output format:

  [optional]   oldlibs/        pam: 0.57b-0.2 is newer than 0.57b-0. [libc6]

 becomes

  libs/pam_0.57b-0.2.dsc [optional:libc6]

* The section and version are now correct for the source package,
  courtesy of Packages-sources.


Version 0.20 - 9th April, 1998

* Quinn Diff now knows about multi-binary source packages, and lists
  them instead of listing several individual binary packages as if
  they bore no relation to each other.  Before MBS-recognition:

   [optional]   admin/          libpam0g-util has not been compiled for m68k. [libc6] 
   [optional]   devel/          libpam0g-dbg: 0.57b-0.2 is newer than 0.57b-0. [neither] 
   [optional]   devel/          libpam0g-dev: 0.57b-0.2 is newer than 0.57b-0. [neither] 
   [optional]   libs/           libpam0g: 0.57b-0.2 is newer than 0.57b-0. [libc6] 
   [optional]   oldlibs/        libpam0-altdev: 0.57b-0.2 is newer than 0.57b-0. [neither] 
   [optional]   oldlibs/        libpam0-altutil: 0.57b-0.2 is newer than 0.57b-0. [libc5] 
   [optional]   oldlibs/        libpam0: 0.57b-0.2 is newer than 0.57b-0. [libc5] 

  After MBS-recognition:

   [optional]   oldlibs/        pam: 0.57b-0.2 is newer than 0.57b-0. [libc6]

  This still needs some work (e.g. section and version are wrong), but
  it is a big step forward.

* A new example script is provided, called quinn4.sh, which splits
  quinn diff output into two parts: unported packages and out-of-date
  packages.

* Lots of updates to Packages-arch-specific have been made.

* A bug was fixed where two packages on one architecture with the same
  name would kill quinn diff.


Version 0.13 - 24th November, 1997

* There is now a Packages-arch-specific file, which lists binary
  packages which are specific to an architecture.  As a result, any
  packages which aren't compilable on the secondary architecture won't
  be listed in quinn diff's output.

* quinn1.sh now uses ftpget (it's free and is from the excellent lftp
  package) and gets a compressed packages file.

* Quinn Diff now tells you if a package is depends, suggests or
  recommends xlib6*.  This is a useful indication of whether or not a
  package requires X11 to build.


Version 0.12 - 6th September, 1997

* If the Packages file of the secondary had an Architecture: all
  package as it's first package, quinn diff would hang.  Fixed.


Version 0.11 - 4th September, 1997

* A nasty bug in parseversion was causing packages to erroneously be
  marked as older on the primary than the secondary when they really
  weren't.

* If --warn-older was used, the output wasn't the same as the output
  for warnings about qpackages out of date on the secondary
  architecture.


Version 0.10 - 15th October, 1997

* Quinn Diff now tells you if a package is libc5 based or libc6 based
  on the primary architecture.

* Quinn diff now gets the architecture string for "has not been
  compiled on m68k" from the Packages file, a major step away from
  user-level i386 vs. m68k hardcoded-ness.


Version 0.02 - 4th July, 1997

* New output format a la ruari-diff.


Version 0.01 

* Ruari diff now outputs something sensible when it encounters
  packages without a priority or a section.

* The output is now padded, to look nicer.

* ruari.sh is now known as ruari1.sh and is much easier to customize.

* ruari2.sh is a new script to sort the output according to priority.


Version pre-0.00 

* Store the Packages-secondary in a hash table, speed increase is impressive.

  This is the results of time --verbose, on what was IIRC a fast i486
  machine.  The second one is quinn-diff, the Mary Wana edition.

quinn-diff (0.64) unstable; urgency=low

  * quinn-diff now distinguishes between 'partial' and 'uncompiled'
    packages; the former being where some binary packages built by a
    source package are missing but the packages is otherwise up-to-date
    and the latter meaning that none of a source package's architecture
    dependent packages have been recompiled for the architecture.

quinn-diff (0.63) unstable; urgency=low

  * If the binary is newer than the source ensure the binary is built from
    that source; works around (some) problems with packages lieing about

quinn-diff (0.50) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rewrite.  Quinn Diff now compares a Packages file and a Sources
    file, i.e. it compares any given architecture to the source not to
    some other architecture.  This gets us away from the broken model of a
    primary and secondary architecture, which wasn't always true.  It also
    allows one to run quinn diff for the i386 ``port''.
  * Packages marked as hurd-i386 specific in Packages-arch-specific are
    now correctly noted as such.
  * There is now a man page.  [#33806]
  * Packages-arch-specific is now installed into /etc/ and Quinn Diff
    looks for it there.
  * debian/control (Recommends): we no longer need python-base.
  * debian/rules (build): don't run the test suite, it's no longer usable.
  * debian/rules (binary-arch): compress the new manpage.  Mark
    /etc/Packages-arch-specific as a conffile.  Other minor changes.

 -- James Troup <james@nocrew.org>  Sun, 30 May 1999 17:37:10 +0100

quinn-diff (0.45) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control (Standards-Version): updated to 2.5.0.0.
  * debian/rules (binary-arch): install README*, not just `README', into
    /usr/doc/quinn-diff/.
  * debian/rules (build): run the new test suite (such as it is).
  * debian/control: fix typo in long description (`exlcude' ->
    `exclude'). (Lintian)
  * create_Packages-source has been sped up more.
  * Quinn Diff was broken by recent Packages files which has gnome-*
    packages with Depends lines in excess of 400 characters; sick of
    hardcoded limits in quinn diff, I've removed them all.
  * Quinn Diff now uses GTK+'s glib library for hash functions rather than
    libdb.  libdb was overkill and the version from glibc 2.1 didn't work
    with quinn diff.  glib's hash functions are more light weight and
    better suited to what quinn diff is doing and switching to it fixed
    several previously unresolveable problems with the new use of
    dynamically allocated memory for all strings related to input.
  * Quinn Diff now uses less memory after the plugging of some memory
    leaks and more intelligent freeing of buffers.
  * A bug in code that tried to handle broken Packages-sources file has
    been fixed so it won't output epochs as part of a source package
    version number.

quinn-diff (0.44) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control (Recommends): recommend debianutils (>= 1.7) for
    mktemp.
  * A stupid bug which was causing problems (alphabetically early
    Architecture: all packages were being erroneously listed as
    uncompiled) on underpopulated architectures (e.g. hurd-i386) has been
    fixed.
  * The example scripts have been improved in small ways and fixed in some
    cases (quinn-diff_split_by_status has been broken since 0.41.)

 -- James Troup <james@nocrew.org>  Sat, 17 Oct 1998 05:09:26 +0100

quinn-diff (0.43) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control (Recommends): downgrade python-base dependency to a
    recommendation and also recommend lftp which all the snarf_Packages-*
    example scripts use.
  * debian/control: improved extended description.
  * quinn diff will now die on duplicates in the Packages-source file as
    this invariable represents a mirror in a bad way and quinn diff's
    output will be compromised.
  * A heuristic designed to help spot bad mirrors, which was actually
    causing information lossage in rare cases, has been disabled.
  * quinn diff now checks for a version string in the first line of
    Packages-arch-specific; if it finds a version newer than it can parse,
    it will refuse to even try.
  * quinn diff now supports exclusionary architecture fields in the
    Packages-arch-specific-file, e.g. "!m68k" means that the package is
    suitable for all architectures _except_ m68k.

 -- James Troup <james@nocrew.org>  Wed,  7 Oct 1998 11:39:30 +0100

quinn-diff (0.42) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules (binary-arch): no need for fix_scripts anymore.
  * debian/fix_scripts: removed.
  * debian/control (Depends): depend on python-base for
    create_Packages-source.
  * debian/copyright: new maintainer address.
  * Quinn Diff now accepts a -o/--source-packages option for specifiying
    an alternate name for Packages-source.
  * A spurious debugging error() call which was left in by mistake has
    been removed.
  * Quinn diff will no longer crash on malformed Packages-* files.
  * snarf_Packages-source has been supplemented by a python script to
    replace the spawning of several thousands seds, speeding it up by some
    26 times or more.
  * Quinn diff will now complain loudly about duplicates in the
    Packages-source file and die on libdb-related errors.
  * Quinn diff no longer tries to guess if the package is libc5 or libc6
    based as this information was only useful during the libc5 -> libc6
    conversion process hamm underwent.

 -- James Troup <james@nocrew.org>  Sun, 27 Sep 1998 14:43:58 +0100

quinn-diff (0.41) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control (Maintainer): new address.
  * Quinn diff now handles the long version strings like
    "4.17-4.m68k.objc.threads.hwwp.fpu.gnat" found in slink.
  * The snarf_Packages-source script has been rewritten to be less
    insecure, more flexible and suck less.
  * The configure script now supports --with-includes, --with-efence and
    --with-debug.
  * The -D/--debug option accepts "help" as an argument and displays
    help information on receiving it.

quinn-diff (0.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * --debug short form -d becomes -D, per YAWN and dpkg.
  * New option -w/--visible-warn, controls what category of suspect
    packages are displayed.
  * debian/rules (binary-arch): call fix_scripts.
  * debian/fix_scripts: fix the bang path of shell scripts on the fly.

quinn-diff (0.32) unstable; urgency=high

  * Umm, duh, 0.31 was missing the quinn diff binary. Thanks to Christian
    T. Steigies <exp114@physik.uni-kiel.de> for noticing my cluelessness.
  * debian/rules (binary-arch): pass "`pwd`/debian/tmp/usr/" not
    "debian/tmp/usr/" as the latter has the Makefile installing quinn diff
    into src/debian/tmp/usr/.
  * debian/control (Standards-Version): updated to 2.4.1.0.

 -- James Troup <jjtroup@comp.brad.ac.uk>  Wed,  6 May 1998 18:42:59 +0200

quinn-diff (0.31) unstable; urgency=low

  * Most of the example scripts have been updated so that they work again.
  * Quinn Diff will now print "uncompiled" or "out-of-date" for each
    package depending on whether or not the package has ever been compiled
    on the secondary architecture before or not.

 -- James Troup <jjtroup@comp.brad.ac.uk>  Sat, 18 Apr 1998 19:53:03 +0200

quinn-diff (0.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * The --warn-missing-lines and --warn-duplicates command line switches
    no longer exist.  --warn-missing-lines is now implemented in a more
    sane fashion with checks for existence only done on relevant lines,
    and --warn-duplicates is now enabled through the new --debug switch.

  * Quinn Diff will no longer die on duplicate packages in the
    Packages-arch-specific file, it'll will (silently or not, as --debug
    dictates) ignore the duplicates.

  * Quinn Diff's command line interface has changed.  It's no longer
    necessary (or even possible) to specify the two Packages files as
    arguments, instead there are 3 new command line options:

     -a --arch-specific-packages  filename of Packages-arch-specific file.
                                   default: Packages-arch-specific in cwd
     -p --primary-packages        filename of primary architectures Packages file.
                                   default: Packages-primary in cwd
     -s --secondary-packages      filename of secondary architectures Packages file.
                                   default: Packages-secondary in cwd

  * Quinn Diff now correctly exits with an error message when passed an
    unrecognised command line option.

  * Quinn Diff now requires a new file Packages-sources, this file lists
    the section and version number of every source package.  There is a
    script (quinn1.3.sh) as a (poor) example of how to generate a
    Packages-sources file.

  * Quinn Diff has a new output format:

     [optional]   oldlibs/        pam: 0.57b-0.2 is newer than 0.57b-0. [libc6]

    becomes

     libs/pam_0.57b-0.2.dsc [optional:libc6]

    The section and version are now correct for the source package,
    courtesy of Packages-sources.
  * debian/rules (binary-arch): install new THANKS file.
  * debian/rules (build): don't override the default CFLAGS.

 -- James Troup <jjtroup@comp.brad.ac.uk>  Fri, 10 Apr 1998 23:14:40 +0200

quinn-diff (0.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Quinn Diff now knows about multi-binary source packages, and lists
    them instead of listing several individual binary packages as if they
    bore no relation to each other.  This still needs some work
    (e.g. section and version are wrong), but it is a start.
  * A new example script is provided, called quinn4.sh, which splits quinn
    diff output into two parts: unported packages and out-of-date
    packages.
  * Lots of updates to Packages-arch-specific have been made.
  * A bug was fixed where two packages on one architecture with the same
    name would kill quinn diff.
  * debian/copyright: general update.  GPL in /usr/doc/copyright is no
    longer compressed.  Update FSF's address.
  * debian/control (Section): Change to devel.
  * debian/control (Priority): Change to extra.
  * debian/control (Standards-Version): Upgrade to 2.4.0.0.
  * debian/control (short description): improved.
  * debian/rules: rewritten.

quinn-diff (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

    has an indicator of whether or not a package needs X11 to build and
    quinn1.sh now uses ftpget and fetches compressed Packages files.

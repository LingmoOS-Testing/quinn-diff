.SH NAME
quinn-diff \- Compare a Packages and Sources file
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBquinn-diff\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR ] [ \fB\fI...\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBquinn-diff\fR compares a Sources file and a Packages files to determine which programs need (re)compiled from source for any given architecture.
.PP
\fBquinn-diff\fR knows about architecture specific packages (e.g. lilo) and can easily exclude them via a Packages-arch-specific file.  The output is a list of source packages complete with accurate section and version information, suitable for use in build daemons or just in a script to auto-snarf the necessary source.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-a/--arch-specific-packages=\fIfile\fB\fR
Specify the location of the Packages-arch-specific file.  The default is /etc/Packages-arch-specific.
.TP
\fB-A/--architecture=\fIarchitecture\fB\fR
Specify the architecture of the Packages file.  If this option is not given, \fBquinn-diff\fR will try to determine the architecture from the contents of the Packages file.
.TP
\fB-D/--debug=\fIoctal value\fB\fR
Enable debug output; see -Dhelp or --debug=help for details on possible values.
.TP
\fB-h/--help\fR
Display usage help and then exit.
.TP
\fB-i/--ignore-arch-all\fR
If this option is enabled \fBquinn-diff\fR will ignore source packages which are marked as 'Architecture: all'.
.TP
\fB-p/--packages=\fIfile\fB\fR
Specify the location of the Packages file.  The default is Packges in the current directory.
.TP
\fB-s/--sources=\fIfile\fB\fR
Specify the location of the Sources file.  The default is Sources in the current directory.
.TP
\fB-w/--warn-older\fR
If this option is enabled \fBquinn-diff\fR will warn when a package is newer in the Packages file than it is in the Sources file.
.TP
\fB-V/--version\fR
Display the version number and then exit.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP
\fBquinn-diff\fR returns zero on normal operation, non-zero on error.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
The most obvious known problem is that \fBquinn-diff\fR trusts the Binary: field from the Sources file which is not a good idea.  However this affects only a small number of packages and is non-trivial to fix.
.SH "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS"
.PP
Special thanks to NoCrew for providing unrewarding and generous donation of network services; without them I wouldn't have had an FTP site, a web site, CVS or AnonCVS.
.SH "AUTHOR"

GAR! This code is HORRIBLE.  I *SUCK*.  parse_package() is an
abomination... all the sad stupid little hacks (e.g. the code in
parse_sources() to split up the Binary: field.. I mean, that's what?
One line in python or perl.), all the stupid assumptions
(e.g. Package: being the first field) etc. etc.

[*] compiled/out-of-date needs to take into account arch: all packages.

[*] .ruari-quinn_rc support

[*] Add configure time tests for __attribute__ support.

[*] Does Packages-arch-specific really need to buffer lines?

[*] Improve junk.sh to check the exit code of quinn diff and do clever
    things if it fails (e.g. try another mirror)

[*] Re-add version number comparsions optionally

[*] Variable (printf style) output format?

[*] Documentation.

[*] Test suite.
